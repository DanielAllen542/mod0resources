# Top Resources

* MDN  
 One of my favorite resources is MDN web docs. This resource really helps me simplify difficult tasks.

* Stack

My next favorite resource would be stack overflow. I just really like their set up and almost always if i can't find what i'm looking for on MDN then it'll most likely be on stack overflow

* Google

Google is the ultimate resource to find all resources. It's like that one friend who knows everyone.
