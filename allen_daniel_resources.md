# Top Resources

* MDN  
 One of my favorite resources is MDN web docs. This resource really helps me simplify difficult tasks. Its use of examples in many scenarios really helps me paint a picture of what the newly learned material is actually saying.

* Stack

My next favorite resource would be stack overflow. I just really like their set up and almost always if i can't find what i'm looking for on MDN then it'll most likely be on stack overflow. It's great because its pretty active and has many actual people popping around to help others.

* Google

Google is the ultimate resource to find all resources. It's like that one friend who knows everyone. There are many time where it's pretty hard for me to find what i'm looking for in my two specific resources so sometimes i have to reach out further and find some extra ones.

* Youtube

Youtube is just the best when it comes to quick learning for myself. And i'm sure for many others as well. I use youtube to solidify what i just learned in some readings.
